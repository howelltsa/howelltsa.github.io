# Howell TSA Landing Page


This theme was made for the 2020 New Jersey Technology Student Assosiation State Conference, which is held at TCNJ every year.

I am a staunch believer in open source code, so if you feel the need to use this code for your own project, feel free! I only ask that you do NOT attempt to use this for your TSA project. Before building last years site, I didn't even know what Bootstrap was, and I hope to use and expand upon the knowledge I have gained from last year to build the best site I can.

# License

This project is free to use for personal or buisness use, but only AFTER the 2020 National Conference in Nashville, Tennessee has concluded. Also, if you do plan to use this code, I ask that you expand upon it and make it better. 

# Other Information

This website is copyrighted until July 3rd, 2020. I ask that you do not use any aspects of the design or code until that date.


THANK YOU!
